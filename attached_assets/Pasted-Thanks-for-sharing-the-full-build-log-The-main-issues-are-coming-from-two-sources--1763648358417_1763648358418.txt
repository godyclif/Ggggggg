Thanks for sharing the full build log. The main issues are coming from **two sources**:

---

### **1️⃣ React Hook warnings (`useEffect`)**

You have multiple warnings like:

```
Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'searchShipment'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.
```

**Cause:**
React wants all dependencies used inside `useEffect` to be included in the dependency array. This ensures the effect updates correctly when the values change.

**Fix examples:**

```ts
// Before
useEffect(() => {
  searchShipment();
}, []); // ❌ searchShipment missing

// After
useEffect(() => {
  searchShipment();
}, [searchShipment]); // ✅
```

**Tips:**

* For functions declared inside the component, wrap them with `useCallback` if you don’t want the effect to run on every render.
* For variables, just include them in the array.

### **2️⃣ Next.js `useSearchParams()` errors**

You have repeated errors like:

```
useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/about"
```

**Cause:**
In Next.js 14+, `useSearchParams()` is **client-only**. If you use it in a **server component** or during **static generation**, Next.js can’t resolve it at build time. That’s why the static export fails for many pages.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wrap your component using `useSearchParams` in a client component**:

```ts
'use client';

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const id = searchParams.get('id');
  return <div>ID: {id}</div>;
}
```

2. **Don’t use `useSearchParams` in pages/components that are statically generated (`getStaticProps`)**. Move them to client-only components.

3. **Optional:** Wrap in a `Suspense` boundary if using it with server components:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <MyClientComponent />
</Suspense>
```

---

### **3️⃣ Image optimization warnings**

Next.js recommends using `<Image />` instead of `<img>`:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" width={100} height={50} />
```

This improves LCP and bandwidth usage.

---

✅ **Summary of fixes:**

1. Add missing dependencies in `useEffect` or use `useCallback` for functions.
2. Ensure `useSearchParams()` is only used in **client components**.
3. Replace `<img>` with `<Image />` from `next/image` for better performance.

---

If you want, I can **rewrite one of your pages** (e.g., `/about`) to fix all the `useSearchParams()` build errors so that your production build succeeds. This will give a concrete example you can apply to the rest.

Do you want me to do that?
